Advantages of GraphQL:
1. Efficiency:
Clients get exactly the data they need, reducing over-fetching and improving performance.
2. Flexibility:
Developers can iterate on the frontend without requiring changes to the backend. New fields can be added to the schema without breaking existing clients.
3. Reduced Number of Requests:
GraphQL often requires fewer requests than REST to fetch the same amount of data.
4. Improved Developer Experience:
Introspection and strong typing provide excellent documentation and tooling support.
5. Real-time Capabilities:
Built-in support for real-time data updates through subscriptions.
Getting Started:
To get started with GraphQL, you can use tools like Apollo Server or Express to create a GraphQL server. Clients can then use libraries like Apollo Client or Relay to interact with the GraphQL API.
